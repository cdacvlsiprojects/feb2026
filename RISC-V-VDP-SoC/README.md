## RISC-V Video Display Processor System-on-Chip

**Document Type:** Project Technical Documentation / Viva Reference  
**Status:** RTL Integration and Directed Verification Baseline  
**Revision:** 1.0  
**Architecture:** RV32I-class RISC-V + Native Memory-Mapped SoC  
**Primary Verification Direction:** SystemVerilog / UVM  
**Target:** FPGA prototyping and ASIC-style RTL development

---

# 1. Project Overview

RISCV-VDP-SoC is a compact RISC-V-based System-on-Chip integrating a processor, on-chip RAM, memory-mapped peripherals, and a video display subsystem.

The current architecture is centered around a PicoRV32/RV32I-class processor. The processor's native memory interface is converted into a clean SoC master transaction interface through a CPU bus adapter. A combinational memory interconnect performs system address decoding and routes each transaction to the appropriate slave.

The principal integrated blocks are:

- RISC-V/PicoRV32 processor
- CPU native-bus adapter
- SoC memory interconnect
- On-chip RAM
- GPIO peripheral
- Sensor status peripheral
- RF telemetry peripheral
- Video Display Processor (VDP)
- VGA timing/display interface
- Clock/reset infrastructure where required
- SystemVerilog directed verification
- Planned/ongoing UVM-based verification

The project is intended to demonstrate both **RTL/SoC integration** and **Design Verification (DV)** capability.

# 4. Processor Subsystem

## 4.1 RISC-V Processor

The CPU subsystem uses a PicoRV32/RV32I-class RISC-V processor.

The processor exposes a native memory interface containing signals such as:

```text
mem_valid
mem_instr
mem_addr
mem_wdata
mem_wstrb
mem_ready
mem_rdata
```

The processor does not directly know about the internal peripheral implementation. It generates memory transactions, and the SoC infrastructure determines where those transactions go.

## 4.2 Why RISC-V?

RISC-V was selected because:

- The ISA is open.
- It is suitable for academic and research SoC development.
- Compact implementations are available.
- The architecture is well suited to FPGA prototyping.
- It allows processor, memory and peripheral integration without dependence on a proprietary ISA.

## 4.3 Why PicoRV32?

PicoRV32 is appropriate for this project because:

- It is compact.
- It provides a simple native memory interface.
- It is suitable for FPGA/ASIC-oriented RTL.
- Its interface is straightforward to integrate with a custom memory subsystem.

---

# 5. CPU Bus Adapter

## Purpose

The CPU bus adapter separates PicoRV32-specific memory-interface semantics from the generic SoC master-side interface.

### CPU-side signals

```text
mem_valid
mem_instr
mem_addr
mem_wdata
mem_wstrb
mem_ready
mem_rdata
```

### SoC-side signals

```text
m_valid
m_write
m_addr
m_wdata
m_strb
m_ready
m_rdata
```

Conceptually:

```text
PicoRV32
   |
   | mem_valid / mem_addr / mem_wdata / mem_wstrb
   v
CPU Bus Adapter
   |
   | m_valid / m_write / m_addr / m_wdata / m_strb
   v
SoC Interconnect
```

## Design Rationale

The adapter creates a clean boundary between the processor and the rest of the SoC.

Benefits:

- CPU-specific protocol logic remains localized.
- The interconnect does not need to understand every CPU-specific detail.
- A different CPU can potentially be integrated by replacing the adapter.
- Verification can treat the adapter boundary as a stable transaction interface.

---

# 6. SoC Memory Interconnect

## 6.1 Function

`soc_mem_interconnect` is the central memory-mapped routing block.

It:

1. Receives a transaction from the CPU-side master.
2. Decodes the system address.
3. Selects exactly one target region.
4. Passes the transaction to the selected slave.
5. Converts peripheral system addresses into 12-bit local addresses.
6. Returns `ready` and `rdata` from the selected slave.
7. Completes unmapped accesses with zero data.

The current implementation is **combinational**.

## 6.2 Important Architectural Point

The interconnect itself does not contain a clock or reset because the current implementation is combinational.

Transaction latency is supplied by the selected slave.

Therefore, the top-level should **not connect `clk` or `resetn` to `soc_mem_interconnect`** unless the architecture is later changed to a registered/pipelined interconnect.

---

# 7. Address Map

| Region | Base Address | Window |
|---|---:|---:|
| RAM | `0x0000_0000` | 64 KB address window |
| GPIO | `0x0001_0000` | 4 KB |
| RF | `0x0001_1000` | 4 KB |
| Sensor | `0x0001_2000` | 4 KB |
| VDP | `0x0001_3000` | 4 KB |

## Peripheral Local Addressing

Each peripheral receives:

```text
system address[11:0]
```

Example:

```text
System address = 0x0001_200C

Interconnect:
    Sensor selected
    sensor_addr = 12'h00C
```

This keeps global system address decoding inside the interconnect and local register decoding inside the peripheral.

---

# 8. Native Bus Convention

The internal SoC bus uses a PicoRV32-compatible native transaction model.

### Request

```text
m_valid = 1
```

indicates a valid request.

### Operation

```text
m_write = 1  -> write
m_write = 0  -> read
```

### Byte strobes

```text
m_strb = 4'b0000 -> read
m_strb != 4'b0000 -> write
```

Each strobe bit corresponds to a byte lane.

For 32-bit data:

```text
m_strb[0] -> bits [7:0]
m_strb[1] -> bits [15:8]
m_strb[2] -> bits [23:16]
m_strb[3] -> bits [31:24]
```

---

# 9. RAM Subsystem

The RAM interface is:

```text
clk
reset
valid
write
addr
wdata
strb
ready
rdata
```

The system interconnect retains the complete 32-bit system address.

At the RAM instance, only the address bits required by the configured RAM depth are passed to the memory array.

## Important Distinction

The current address map provides a **64-KB RAM address window**, but the current default instantiated memory depth is:

```text
RAM_DEPTH = 256 words
DATA_WIDTH = 32 bits
```

Therefore:

```text
256 × 32 bits
= 8192 bits
= 1024 bytes
= 1 KB
```

The address window and physical instantiated RAM capacity should not be confused.

---

# 10. GPIO Peripheral

The GPIO peripheral uses a native PicoRV32-style slave interface.

## Register Map

| Offset | Register | Access | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | `GPIO_DATA_OUT` | R/W | GPIO output data |
| `0x04` | `GPIO_DATA_IN` | RO | Synchronized input snapshot |
| `0x08` | `GPIO_DIR` | R/W | Output-enable direction |
| `0x0C` | `GPIO_STATUS` | RO | Write-pulse status |

## GPIO Data Path

```text
CPU write
   |
Interconnect
   |
GPIO DATA_OUT
   |
gpio_out
```

For input:

```text
gpio_in
   |
2-FF Synchronizer
   |
GPIO_DATA_IN
   |
CPU read
```

## CDC / Metastability

External GPIO inputs may be asynchronous to the SoC clock.

The peripheral therefore uses a two-flop synchronizer.

This reduces the probability of metastability propagating into synchronous logic.

---

# 11. Sensor Status Peripheral

The sensor peripheral exposes:

- Battery percentage
- Battery voltage
- Temperature
- Sensor-valid status

Representative external inputs:

```text
battery_percent_i      [7:0]
battery_voltage_mv_i   [15:0]
temperature_tenthsC_i  [15:0]
sensor_valid_i
```

The native slave interface uses:

```text
mem_valid
mem_instr
mem_ready
mem_addr[11:0]
mem_wdata[31:0]
mem_wstrb[3:0]
mem_rdata[31:0]
```

## Current Status

The sensor peripheral is integrated into the SoC top-level.

The remaining task is complete end-to-end validation through the integrated CPU/UVM path.

This should be presented as **under validation**, rather than as a fully demonstrated result.

---

# 12. RF Telemetry Peripheral

The RF telemetry peripheral provides memory-mapped access to telemetry information.

Inputs include:

```text
rssi_dbm_i
link_up_i
link_error_i
carrier_detect_i
```

The peripheral also exposes an RF enable/control output:

```text
rf_enable_o
```

The peripheral is intended to provide a software-visible telemetry/control interface.

## Current Status

The native RF slave interface has been implemented and integrated at the interconnect level.

Deeper end-to-end validation remains part of the final verification phase.

---

# 13. Video Display Processor

The VDP provides a memory-mapped CPU configuration interface and an independent VGA pixel-clock domain.

## CPU-side interface

```text
clk
resetn
mem_valid
mem_instr
mem_ready
mem_addr[11:0]
mem_wdata[31:0]
mem_wstrb[3:0]
mem_rdata[31:0]
```

## Display-side interface

```text
pixel_clk
hsync_o
vsync_o
pixel_x_o
pixel_y_o
rgb_r_o[3:0]
rgb_g_o[3:0]
rgb_b_o[3:0]
```

## Clock Domains

There are at least two relevant clock domains:

```text
System / CPU Clock
       |
       | configuration
       v
      VDP
       |
       | CDC
       v
Pixel Clock Domain
       |
       +---- HSYNC
       +---- VSYNC
       +---- RGB
```

The pixel-clock domain must maintain deterministic display timing independently of CPU activity.

---

# 14. Reset Architecture

The SoC contains both synchronous and clock-domain-specific reset requirements.

The native GPIO and sensor-style synchronous logic uses an active-low reset convention:

```text
resetn
```

The RAM uses:

```text
reset
```

where the exact polarity/behavior must match the `soc_ram` implementation.

The combinational interconnect has no reset.

## Key Rule

Do not add reset ports to a module merely because it is instantiated in a clocked subsystem.

Reset should exist only where sequential state requires it.

---

# 15. Top-Level Integration

The integrated top-level is conceptually:

```text
cpu_soc_ram_top
|
+-- PicoRV32 / CPU
|
+-- CPU Bus Adapter
|
+-- soc_mem_interconnect
|
+-- soc_ram
|
+-- gpio_native_slave
|
+-- sensor_status_native_slave
|
+-- rf_telemetry_native_slave
|
+-- vdp_native_slave
```

The top-level connects:

- System clock
- Active-low system reset
- External sensor inputs
- GPIO external pins
- RF external signals/control
- Pixel clock
- VGA outputs
- CPU trap output

```

---

---

# 19. UVM Verification Plan

The final UVM environment should be transaction-based.

## Proposed Components

```text
uvm_test
   |
uvm_env
   |
   +-- soc_agent
   |      |
   |      +-- sequencer
   |      +-- driver
   |      +-- monitor
   |
   +-- predictor/reference model
   |
   +-- scoreboard
   |
   +-- coverage
```

## Transaction

A transaction should represent:

```text
address
write/read
write_data
byte_strobes
expected/observed response
```

## Driver

Converts a transaction into native-bus signals.

## Monitor

Samples the interface and reconstructs transactions.

## Predictor

Determines the expected target and response using the same architectural address map.

## Scoreboard

Compares observed behavior against expected behavior.

---

# 20. UVM Smoke Test

The first UVM test should remain small.

Recommended sequence:

```text
RESET
  |
RAM WRITE
  |
RAM READ
  |
RAM CHECK
  |
GPIO WRITE
  |
GPIO READ
  |
GPIO CHECK
  |
SENSOR READ
  |
RF READ
  |
VDP ACCESS
  |
UNMAPPED ACCESS
  |
PASS / FAIL
```

The smoke test should validate the complete UVM infrastructure before constrained-random testing is introduced.



---

# 21. Constrained-Random Verification

After smoke testing, randomize:

- Address.
- Read/write operation.
- Write data.
- Byte strobes.
- Peripheral region.
- Back-to-back accesses.
- Repeated accesses.
- Boundary addresses.

Useful constraints include:

```text
valid address region
aligned/unaligned policy as supported
legal byte strobes
read/write distribution
peripheral selection distribution
```

---

# 22. Functional Coverage

Recommended coverage points:

## Address Region

```text
RAM
GPIO
RF
SENSOR
VDP
UNMAPPED
```

## Operation

```text
READ
WRITE
```

## Byte Strobe

```text
0000
0001
0010
0100
1000
1111
other legal combinations
```

## Cross Coverage

```text
ADDRESS_REGION × OPERATION
ADDRESS_REGION × BYTE_STROBE
```

Additional coverage can include:

- Boundary addresses.
- Reset-to-first-transaction behavior.
- Back-to-back transactions.
- Peripheral-specific register accesses.

---

# 23. Assertions

Potential SystemVerilog Assertions include:

### Valid request selects at most one slave

```text
$onehot0({
    ram_valid,
    gpio_valid,
    rf_valid,
    sensor_valid,
    vdp_valid
})
```

### Peripheral select requires master validity

```text
gpio_valid |-> m_valid
```

and similarly for other peripherals.

### Local address range

Peripheral addresses should remain within:

```text
0x000 - 0xFFF
```

### Response routing

When a slave is selected, the master response should correspond to that slave.

Assertions can also verify:

- No illegal simultaneous selection.
- Correct response propagation.
- Unmapped transaction completion.
- Stable request behavior where required by the protocol.

---

# 24. Formal Verification

Formal verification can complement simulation. Though z3 doesnt performs well for the complex codes.

Useful properties include:

- Address decode correctness.
- One-hot slave selection.
- No illegal target selection.
- Unmapped accesses terminate.
- Ready propagation.
- Local-address extraction.
- Byte-strobe propagation.
- Reset behavior.

The interconnect is particularly suitable for formal verification because much of its behavior is deterministic combinational routing.

---

# 25. Why a Scoreboard Is Not Always Required at Every SoC Boundary

A common misconception is:

> "Every SoC testbench must have one giant scoreboard."

That is not necessarily true.

A scoreboard is valuable when the expected transaction/result can be modeled effectively.

At SoC level, verification can also use:

- Assertions.
- Protocol monitors.
- Architectural state checking.
- Reference models.
- Software self-checking.
- Memory models.
- Functional coverage.
- End-to-end checking.

For this project, a **small predictor/checker for the memory interconnect** is useful because the expected target and response are deterministic.

# 34. Key Viva Questions and Answers

## Q1. What is the project?

A RISC-V-based memory-mapped SoC integrating RAM, GPIO, sensor, RF telemetry and VDP/VGA, supported by directed and UVM-oriented verification.

## Q2. Why RISC-V?

Because it is an open ISA with compact implementations and is well suited for academic, FPGA and research-oriented SoC development.

## Q3. Why PicoRV32?

It provides a compact RV32 processor and a simple native memory interface that is easy to integrate.

## Q4. Is the internal bus AXI?

No. The current CPU-to-peripheral path uses the PicoRV32 native memory interface. AXI4-Lite can be used at an external boundary in a future architecture.

## Q5. Why use a bus adapter?

To isolate PicoRV32-specific interface semantics from the generic SoC interconnect.

## Q6. Why are peripheral addresses 12 bits?

Each peripheral has a 4-KB window, so only the lower 12 address bits are required after global decoding.

## Q7. What happens to an unmapped access?

It completes with `m_ready = 1` and zero read data because the native bus has no AXI-style error response.

## Q8. What has actually been verified?

The directed interconnect tests verify routing, local address conversion, response propagation, write data/strobes, unmapped accesses and selected-slave behavior. GPIO functionality has also been demonstrated.

## Q9. Is UVM complete?

The UVM environment is the final verification phase/in progress unless actual completed regression evidence is available. Do not claim coverage or pass numbers without simulation evidence.

## Q10. What is the biggest limitation?

The current design is an MVP with a simple single-master interconnect, limited RAM depth, and incomplete end-to-end validation of some peripherals.

## Q11. What is novel?

The project does not claim a novel RISC-V ISA or CPU. Its engineering contribution is the integration of a RISC-V CPU, native-bus adaptation, memory-mapped heterogeneous peripherals, display clock-domain separation, and a scalable verification methodology.

## Q12. What would you add next?

Complete UVM coverage/regression, assertions and formal checks, then add DMA, interrupts, larger memory, improved CDC verification and FPGA validation.
